# Codenames

> A NativeScript implementation of [codenames](https://github.com/joshporter1/codenames).

> _Note: This project is currently just a skeleton of the [original app](http://codenames.codecaffeinated.com/). The goal is to get this implementation 100% working. The current roadblock is SocketIO/websocket connectivity._
